**Rule 1: Reduce your data before joining**
This rule states that you should reduce the data set you’re working on as much as possible before the final select. We’ll talk about several patterns that do this in later chapters on pre-aggregating and pre-filtering data in a CTE before the final join. 

When working with large tables, check to see if there’s partitioning set up on a date column and reduce your data before joining later. For example if you only need one month of data from a large table, check to see if the table has partitioning set up by date or if there’s an index on the date column.

When joining multiple tables, always try to join on the primary key for that table or the most unique column. There’s usually an index or micro-partitioning set up on these columns so by joining on that column you can make your queries faster.
