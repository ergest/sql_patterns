**Rule 2: Only work with the smallest subset of columns you need**
It’s very tempting to always do `SELECT *`in your queries or CTEs, especially if you don’t know which columns you need later. While this may be ok in a traditional RDBMS which store data in rows, cloud warehouse platforms use columnar storage. 

This means that each column you select changes the amount of data you scan and how much compute resources you use. This in turn directly affects the performance of your queries and your bottom line. So avoid using `SELECT *` and be explicit about the columns you’re using.
