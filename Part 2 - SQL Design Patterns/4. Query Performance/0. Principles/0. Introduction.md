The query performance principle states that your queries should as fast as possible while still accurate. 

It’s not just about speed. Yes it’s important to have reports that execute in seconds, but these days performance is directly tied to cost, whether through compute resources spent to run the query or the overall amount of data scanned so performance considerations are directly tied to your bottom line.

He following rules apply in general to both cloud data warehouses and individual relational database management systems (RDBMS). Of course there are plenty of ways to tune up the performance of queries in specific systems through setting up indexes.
