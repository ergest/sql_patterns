**Rule 1: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**
If you find yourself joining the same table multiple times or doing the same calculation, aggregation or filtering, that query chunk is a perfect candidate to be placed into a CTE. Not only does this refactoring make the code easier to read, but it can also identify chunks of code that could be used across multiple queries which can be refactored into views.
