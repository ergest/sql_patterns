The Query Decomposition Principle states that every complex query can and should be broken down into simpler elements that can be written and tested independently.

I don't know about you, but when I first started writing queries professionally to answer business questions, I wanted to show off my smarts. I wanted to get the entire query written in one fell swoop, one single, perfect, beautiful query. Reality, however, had other plans.

You see real world data is messy. From inconsistent field types, missing rows, duplicate rows, unexpected values, etc. I learned pretty quickly that queries, no matter how simple they might seem, needed to be broken down into manageable elements and each one tested individually.

 “The top-down approach starts with a large problem and breaks it down into a set of smaller problems. Then, if the problems are not small enough, as discussed when we looked at the Single Responsibility Principle, we further break down the problem into even smaller ones. The process repeats and eventually the problem is small enough to design and code.”

“The bottom-up approach works in the opposite direction. Given domain knowledge, you can start creating building blocks, and then create more complex ones by composing from these building blocks”
