**Rule 2: Don't mix levels of abstraction**
One of the hardest things about the SQL language is it’s lack of support for libraries and other abstract concepts like objects in languages like Python, Java, etc. This causes many analysts and data scientists to write super complex queries without worrying too much about interdependencies.

Dependencies across multiple queries are one of the hardest problems I’ve ever had to deal with. These happen when you write a query based on multiple tables in multiple levels of abstraction. It’s pretty easy for someone to modify a query to add a column by simply joining the table that has that column. 

However in modern data warehouse environments, tables are not typically self contained, they might depend on other tables and your one line fix might have just made maintenance a nightmare and degraded performance significantly.

When you add a column to your query outside of the typical order of dependency chains you’re instantly making your queries a nightmare to maintain.
