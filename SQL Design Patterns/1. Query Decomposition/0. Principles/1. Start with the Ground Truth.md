**Rule 1: Start with the ground truth**
The ground truth can mean a variety of things but in general it means to start with definitions. The definitions will lead you to the tables you will then need to query. 

Let's say you're being asked to figure out how many users on total visited a certain page on the website. Unless you're very familiar with your data or have done this analysis before, your first questions should be:
1. What's the definition of a user? Is it a web session or only those who have signed in to the website?
2. What's the definition of a visit? Is it when they viewed the page? If so, what's the minimum amount of time spent on the page in order for it to count as a visit?
3. How do we know which page they visited? Is it only available in the URL? If so is there a pattern in the URL that defines it or is it available elsewhere in the system?
