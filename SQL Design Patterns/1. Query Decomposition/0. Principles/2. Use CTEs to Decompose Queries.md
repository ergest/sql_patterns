**Rule 2: Always use CTEs to break down a query**
CTEs, or Common Table Expressions, are essentially temporary result sets that the database system calculates and stores for you before you join them to get the final result. The purpose of this is to break your query down into composable elements.

Yes I know that many SQL books and courses will teach you to use subqueries or derived tables but I'm telling you CTEs are better in most cases. Stick with them and your life will be easier and better.

Defining and using CTEs is really easy and once you learn, you'll wonder why you didn't know it before. Just remember that all CTEs need be defined _before_ you write the actual query.

You define a single CTE using the `WITH` keyword like this:
```
WITH <cte_name> AS (
	SELECT col1
	FROM table_name
)
SELECT *
FROM <cte_name>
```

You define multiple CTEs again using `WITH` keyword like this:
```
WITH <cte1_name> AS (
	SELECT col1
	FROM table1_name
)
, <cte2_name> AS (
	SELECT col1
	FROM table2_name
)
SELECT *
FROM <cte1_name> AS cte1
JOIN <cte2_name> AS cte2 ON cte1.col1 = cte2.col1
```
_Side Note:_ In the example above the CTEs are independently created as they pull results from different tables, but you can also "chain" CTEs when you want to do [[Nesting CTEs]] or [[Multi-step Calculation]] We will cover that design pattern later.
