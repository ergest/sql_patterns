## Introduction
Joining tables is one of the most basic functions in SQL, but what really is a join? I'm no academic, so I won't bore you with relational theory, I'm also not a fan of the Venn diagram way of explaining joins. I'd rather you get an intuitive understanding by example, so let's get to it.

A join is simply a way to get additional information from another table to add to your query. It's akin to a `VLOOKUP` or `MATCH` in Excel. You are basically looking up the values of a column in table 1  in table 2 and displaying the matching rows.

Depending on which matched rows you want to see, you have four options
1. Inner Join only displays the matching rows from both tables
2. Outer Join displays both the matching rows and the non-matching rows
3. Cross Join does a Cartesian product of rows from both tables
4. Self Join is useful when you have hierarchical structures stored in the table

Ok let's look at each one through some examples

### Inner Join
The INNER JOIN does a match 

Let's take a look at the `post_history` table:

```
column_name         |data_type|
--------------------+---------+
id                  |INT64    |
creation_date       |TIMESTAMP|
post_id             |INT64    |
post_history_type_id|INT64    |
revision_guid       |STRING   |
user_id             |INT64    |
text                |STRING   |
comment             |STRING   |
```

We see that this table has a `post_id` and a `user_id` but no information about the post (like the post title) or the user (like the user name) If I wanted to add this information to my query then I'd have to join in the `users` table or any of the posts tables like `post_questions` or `post_answers`

Here's the `users` table schema:

```
column_name      |data_type|
-----------------+---------+
id               |INT64    |
display_name     |STRING   |
about_me         |STRING   |
age              |STRING   |
creation_date    |TIMESTAMP|
last_access_date |TIMESTAMP|
location         |STRING   |
reputation       |INT64    |
up_votes         |INT64    |
down_votes       |INT64    |
views            |INT64    |
profile_image_url|STRING   |
website_url      |STRING   |
```

If we wanted to see all the revisions by a user we'd simply need to join the two tables

Left join to avoid restricting rows
Cross joins for special cases like spine tables
