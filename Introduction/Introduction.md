# Minimum Viable SQL
## Hands-On Design Patterns and Best Practices with SQL

### What makes this book unique?
When I first learned SQL in college, it was truly from the ground up. The database course in the computer science curriculum had us studying relational algebra and set theory. We wrote all our answers to queries in a weird math notation and didn't touch a database until mid-semester. I only learned SQL properly once I got a job and finally started using it. 

If you pick up a SQL introductory book or course, it follows the same “pyramid” pattern. You start with the language basics, you learn the syntax, then you build up from there to increasingly complex concepts.

That way of learning rarely sticks.

If you think about anything you remember really well, you most likely learned it by mapping problems to solutions. More importantly, by mapping many problems to solutions, you start to learn patterns that allow you to recognize and solve certain types of problems instantly.

Experienced analysts and data scientists are able to solve complex queries quickly because they've built up a collection of patterns and best practices that go beyond the SQL syntax. They use these patterns to break down these complex queries into simple elements and solve them quickly.

Actually patterns exist in every field. 

Chefs don’t create recipes from scratch. They use common cooking patterns, like sautéing vegetables, browning meat, making dough, using spices, etc. to create delicious meals. 

Likewise fiction writers use character and plot patterns like romantic comedy, drama, red herring, foreshadowing, cliffhangers, etc.

In programming they’re called design patterns. 

### What are these design patterns?
They're basically mental constructs that act like LEGO pieces for your mind. Like LEGO, they enable you to find solutions to complex problems by mixing and matching.

Whether you are aware of it or not, if you have a lot of experience in a field, you're using patterns to quickly find solutions to novel problems in your field in just minutes.

Studying and learning patterns is the fastest way to level up in any field. The problem is that you need to spend years in that field to learn them and even when you do, you end up learning them haphazardly.

Also nobody teaches this way. You'd need an expert in the field to codify them in a way that are easy to learn and easy to teach.

I’ve been writing SQL for ~15 years. I’ve seen hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Over time I developed a set of patterns and best practices I always come back to when writing queries. I've codified and organized them into best practices so you can learn them and start using them right away.

If you're starting out as a data analyst, scientist or engineer and you study these patterns you'll be able to:
-   Level up your SQL skills in record time without taking yet another boring course
-   Write high-quality, production-ready SQL that's easy to understand and maintain
-   Solve complex queries like an expert without having to wait decades to become on

### How is this book organized?
This book is organized into three parts.

In Part 1 we cover SQL Core Concepts. These are the most important concepts I have found over many years of working with SQL and I still find them useful to this day. In a way these are the smallest building blocks of complex SQL queries.

In Part 2 we cover SQL querying Core Principles. 
These principles act as categories for the patterns while also providing guidelines on how to solve problems quickly and easily:
1. [[Query Decomposition]] which explains how to break down a complex query into easy to write and easy to understand chunks to make sure the query is right
2. [[Query Robustness]] which explains how to ensure that you write code that can deal with unexpected changes to the data or missing data
3. [[Query Performance]] which explains how to write queries that are both accurate and fast without having to rewrite them later
4. [[Query Maintainability]] which explains concepts like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and a few others to ensure your code is easily maintained by future developers

In Part 3 we cover SQL query patterns. These patterns are divided into meta-patterns and regular patterns. The meta-patterns are basically patterns of patterns and are used in almost all the queries and the actual patterns 

This book focuses on querying data with SQL for analytics, data engineering and data science so there’s no discussion on DML
